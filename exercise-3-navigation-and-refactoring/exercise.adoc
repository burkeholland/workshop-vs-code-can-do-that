|Delete Line
|kbd:[Alt] / kbd:[Option] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[k]

== Finding Things

There are a few different ways to find things. One is with the Find/Replace UI, and the other is with the symbol browser.

=== Find using Find/Replace

=== Extracting Methods

The "extract method" refactor is used a lot. It's helpful for when you have a block of code you want to extract into it's own method.

Extract the code that updates the color of the bulb into a method called "updateColor".

.Solution

====
* Find the following block of code...
----
// update the bulb color
bulb.style = `fill: #${color};`;
currentColor.textContent = `#${color}`;
----
* Highlight the text and press kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + `.`
* Select "Extract to method in class App"
* Name it "updateColor"

=== Multiple Cursors: Super Bonus

1. Open the `fake-package.json` file in this folder and select all of the "devDependences"
2. Paste them into a new file - do not save the file
3. Using multiple cursors, transform the list into a valid `npm install` statement...

.Solution
[%collapsible]
====
1. Select the first `"`
2. Add a cursor the front of each line with kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[Alt] / kbd:[Option] + kbd:[↓]
3. Delete the `"` at the start of each line
4. Move all the cursors the end of their relative lines with kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[→]
5. Use kbd:[Alt] / kbd:[Option] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[←] to select text on all lines back to the last `"` and delete the `"`
6. Use kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[←] to move the cursor to the front of the line and add a space
7. Move the cursor to the end of all lines with kbd:[Alt] / kbd:[Option] + kbd:[→] and add a kbd:[,]
8. Highlight the invivible return character on each line and delete it to put all items on one line
